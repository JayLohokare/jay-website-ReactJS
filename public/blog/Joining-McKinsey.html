                                I have been getting tons of questions and criticism from my friends, colleagues, and juniors about my decision to join McKinsey and company; rejecting offers from top tech companies. I am writing this blog to help myself reflect on my decision, and also to get feedback from others in order to validate/criticize my thought process. While writing this blog, I still am unsure if I made the right decision – I hence request readers to message me their opinion (Opinion on the situation I am in, and where I made a right decision).

                                Let me explain the context of this blog – I completed my master’s in computer science from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in December 2018. I had interned at McKinsey and Company in Summer 2018 and was pretty happy about the experience I had while working at McKinsey. I got an offer to return full-time at McKinsey, and my positive summer experience made me think that I shouldn't apply to other roles at all!

								<article>
                                Given I was mostly free in my final semester, I did give a few interviews. By January 2019, I had offers from most of the top tech companies (SDE, ML/DS, Data engineer roles) and also a few offers for consulting roles. 
                                </article>

                                <article>
                                The offers I had were rather interesting - ML role from Alphabet subsidiary (known for its ML work) and consulting role from AWS were few of the offer I seriously considered. The pay offered by McKinsey was the least of these roles I was considering. And yet, I have decided to join McKinsey and company as Data scientist at the Data Engineering team of McKinsey Digital Labs.

                                <article>
                                Before I get into explaining my decision, let me describe the role have at McKinsey. McKinsey has recently started giving a push to its digital consulting efforts. My role at McKinsey is of a data consultant - Helping McKinsey clients figure out their problems related to Data science/Engineering. The interesting part about this role is the focus on what McKinsey calls 'impact' - McKinsey is known to be one of the highest costing consulting firms. Every hour a McKinsey consultant spends at client sites costs extremely high, and so the work done has to be extremely effective. 
                                I loved how even during my internship, I was an integral part of deciding system architecture, communicating with CXO level folks at client sites - I felt important right from day one.

								<article>
                                McKinsey spoilt me -The lifestyle I had at McKinsey makes me reluctant to join any other company for a typical 'desk job' role. Here is what I did every week while working at McKinsey - Fly first class to client sites every Monday (Return on Thursday), stay in 5-star hotels for the entire week, get ridiculously high food allowances. I almost never worked on Fridays, and weekends had a strict no work policy (Not one email from work!). I agree that this lifestyle is not feasible for entire life (The entire concept of 'settling down' ). But at the age of 23, I can't ask for anything better! I love to travel, and working at McKinsey ensures that I will visit most (if not all) corners of USA. 
                                </article>

								<article>
                                I do agree that technology I will get to use at McKinsey will be a step behind that used at top tech companies - tech companies often only 'create' new software, whereas at McKinsey I will often 'consume' software. But even while working at McKinsey, I can keep developing 'core' software, just that it won't be a part of my salary paying job. Yes, McKinsey job won't involve creating new open source frameworks or creating the next Tensorflow. But a clear trend I saw in the tech industry is that such 'innovation' happens only at research positions, not at SDE/ML roles (How-so-ever senior the role be, you are always consuming existing software or adding features, not creating it). And frankly, without a Ph.D. I don't expect a company to trust me with 'creating something new and ground-breaking' for them, and pay me for doing it. I am certain that I will manage to keep an edge in technology even while being with McKinsey due to my association with start-ups that I have been working with for quite some time.

                                The next interesting part at consulting roles is the variety in work - McKinsey serves clients from every single industry one could think of. I can never get exposure to this variety of business ideas, tech stacks, methodologies by working at a typical tech company for SDE/ML role.
                                </article>

                                McKinsey employees have perhaps the world’s most diverse set of backgrounds - People from every industry/profession/education imaginable work in McKinsey. If I work in Google (For the sake of argument), I will meet and work with a pool of really talented people with a tech background. But I have grown to realize that there is more to this world than technical abilities. A very simple example I always think of is that while working at Google, talks people have over lunch will mainly be about latest tech-stacks or architecture choices. At McKinsey, I discussed everything starting with tech to the evolution of human psychology, to how everything in this universe is governed by a probabilistic model, to how Antarctic ice cap will decide the next USA president. The range of ideas I heard made me realize how much I could learn if I am surrounded by such a diverse pool of people! At McKinsey, I did see people with crazy thoughts, but I never felt that any of their talks were rubbish. Every single person had the ability to do what he/she claimed! As one of McKinsey seniors I talked with pointed out - McKinsey is a place where you might meet a person who claims he plans to head Google one day, and the person might do it. I won't even start with how McKinsey is a CXO factory - McKinsey alumni have become CEOs and COOs at numerous top companies (Heard of Sundar Pichai?). Working with such people is certainly an experience I don't want to miss.

                                Another awesome aspect about McKinsey - Dynamic teams. I don't have a 'manager’. Teams are constructed per project/client on demand. McKinsey follows a horizontal management system. For every new client engagement, I will potentially meet new colleagues (from within McKinsey)!

                                I think that the skills and experience I can get working at a core tech firm will be limited (mainly technical). I think I can develop these skills by having indirect connect with the tech world (Through collaborations, open-source work, hackathons and working with start-ups). The skills I hope to develop in next few years are mainly non-technical ones.

                                Working at a top tech company is an obvious safe choice for most sane people. McKinsey even has an 'Up or out' policy - Work good enough to get promoted within a certain time or leave the firm. Compared to such aggressive policy at McKinsey, tech companies offer more stability (More money, less travel, fewer worries about performance). But, I feel that working as a developer at Google won't take me closer to my aim as much as working at McKinsey will. Those who know me well can tell you how much I hate doing a 'job'. Call me crazy, but if I still am doing a job at the age of 30-35, I will consider myself a failure. I intend to own my work and career - something I was pretty open about while interviewing at McKinsey (And they actually supported this idea!).

								<article>
                                I think that McKinsey isn't the final destination, but a stepping stone. At the age of 23, I am not risking a lot by rejecting the highest paying offer. The decision of getting into consulting can always be changed at any point in time - I am certain I can get all my tech offers again 1 year later!

                                <b>"Won't being away from bay area disconnect you from tech world?" -</b> No! McKinsey has an office in the Bay area (I can move to California at any time). I also can visit California (Or anywhere in the USA) every week (Flight tickets paid by McKinsey) thanks to McKinsey's 'Leveraged fly-out' (And you boast about your job perks eh tech industry?)
                                </article>
		
								</br>
								
								<article>
                                Also, my role in McKinsey is 'Data scientist' - To some extent, I feel it's better than working in the bay area tech industry. I get to work on a wide variety of projects compared to working in a tech company (One project, one team - Meh). McKinsey pay is slightly less than what typical SDE L4-5 roles pay in SF/Bay area. However, I think the resultant money in hand is higher than the Bay area counterparts as I spend literally nothing while working at Mckinsey (Perks! Perks!) and the rent I pay living in NYC is less than half for double the studio size compared to California rent.
